[flake8]
# 1. Core Configuration: Rules and Scope
# -------------------------------------

# A comma-separated list of error codes to ignore globally.
# Examples:
# E501: Line too long (often ignored or the max-line-length is adjusted)
# W503: Line break before binary operator (PEP 8 recommends breaking AFTER)
# F401: Unused import (sometimes necessary for type-checking or future use)
ignore = E501, W503, F401

# The maximum allowed line length. Flake8 defaults to 79.
max-line-length = 100

# The maximum allowed McCabe complexity score for functions/methods.
# Flake8 defaults to 10. A lower number means simpler functions.
max-complexity = 12

# 2. File and Directory Exclusion
# -------------------------------

# A comma-separated list of files or directories to exclude from checking.
# This prevents Flake8 from processing automatically generated or third-party code.
exclude = 
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    .venv,
    venv,
    build,
    dist,
    docs,
    */migrations/*,
    settings.py  # Example: Exclude a specific file

# 3. Third-Party Plugin Configuration (Optional)
# ----------------------------------------------

# If you use popular plugins, you can configure them here.

# Example: flake8-docstrings (D)
# select = D # Uncomment to enforce docstring checks (D100 to D417)

# Example: flake8-bugbear (B)
# bugbear-max-cognitive-complexity = 12

# Example: Black-compatible settings
# Setting a line length of 88 is common when using the 'Black' formatter.
# max-line-length = 88
# extend-ignore = E203 # E203 conflicts with Black's spacing rules
